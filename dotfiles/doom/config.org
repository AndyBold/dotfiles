* My (il)literate config for doom
There comes a time in every emacsers life where they consider migrating to a literate config.

For me, this time, it's when my Doom =config.el= hit the 350-ish line mark.

I would normally split this into a number of files to be loaded separately, but Doom Emacs doesn't seem to like that - or my literate configuration for Doom Emacs isn't correct - as Doom only seemed to process this file, and not the files that this file was loading.

I am managing this file with [[https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop][dotdrop]] so some of the code you will see is Jinja template code. It should be obvious what's what.

** Before we start...
Occasionally there are things that I don't want to put in source control in any format. They are often context specific, and if I need them in Emacs then this is how I make them available.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; Load in some personal config before doing anything else
(defun ab-load-file-if-exists (&rest paths)
  "Load files when they exists."
  (dolist (file-path paths)
   (when (file-exists-p file-path)
    (load file-path))))

(ab-load-file-if-exists "~/.emacs-secrets.el")
#+end_src

** Who Am I?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
(setq user-full-name "Andy Bold"
{%@@ if profile == "Nightcrawler" @@%}
      user-mail-address "{{@@ env['work_git_email'] @@}}")
{%@@ elif profile == "Groot" @@%}
      user-mail-address "{{@@ env['my_email'] @@}}")
{%@@ endif @@%}

#+end_src

** Look and Feel
This is not a theme. It's just a place where I configure what theme to use, face configs, and so on. Anything that affects Emacs bling.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:

(setq doom-font "Input Mono")
(setq doom-variable-pitch-font "Gill Sans")
(setq doom-theme 'doom-nord)
#+end_src

** Orgmode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "/Users/andyb/Google Drive File Stream/My Drive/org")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)


;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.
;;

;;
;; Orgmode configuration
;;

;; Add .org.gpg file suffix to the auto-mode list
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\.gpg" . org-mode))

;; Keep a log of when a task was completed.

(add-to-list 'org-agenda-files (expand-file-name "~/Documents/org/*\\.org\\.gpg"))

;; Targets include the current file and any file contributing to the agenda - up to 9 levels deep
