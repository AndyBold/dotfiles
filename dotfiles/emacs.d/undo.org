* Undo and history
** Undo
   The undo-tree package can help make sense of Emacs' very powerful, but often confusing, undo and redo history.
   #+name: undo-things
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
     (use-package undo-tree
       :defer t
       :diminish undo-tree-mode
       :init
       (progn
         (global-undo-tree-mode)
         (setq undo-tree-history-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/tmp/undo"))
               undo-tree-auto-save-history t
               undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t
               undo-tree-visualizer-diff t)))
   #+end_src

** History
   Disk is cheap, so it doesnt hurt to be generous with hanging on to old things.

   Auto-number versions.
   #+name: undo-things
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (setq version-control t)
   #+end_src

   Trim old versions...
   #+name: undo-things
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (setq delete-old-versions t)
   #+end_src

   ...when we have more than 100.
   #+name: undo-things
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
   (setq-default history-length 100)
   #+end_src

   Set where to save the minibuffer history.
   #+name: undo-things
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (setq savehist-file "~/.emacs.d/history"
          history-delete-duplicates t
          savehist-save-minibuffer-history 1
          savehist-additional-variables
          '(kill-ring
            search-ring
            regexp-search-ring))
    (savehist-mode t)
    #+end_src
